It was a dark night in the woods. Tom was sleeping without a care in the world. Suddenly, the door to his cabin creaked open and entered a shadowy person. Tom, unaware of his presence, kept sleeping. The man went to his kitchen, and picked up a big knife and slowly came back to Tom. Still, unaware of his presence, Tom turned towards the man. Fear shot through tom's heart as he saw what the man was about to do. In one hand, he held a knife covered in jelly that had already been applied to the bread held in the other. Slowly the man descended toward Tom's fresh jar of peanutbutter with the unclean knife and with a horeendous thfft, slid it into the soft peanutbuttery goodness, sullying the purity of the jar for all of eternity. Tom let out a blood curdling scream.
